OpenG2P ERP
===========

The “OpenG2P” framework is a set of building blocks based on revamped versions of digital tools employed by the Government of Sierra Leone to pay 30,000 ebola frontline and health workers at the height of the West African Ebola Crisis.
Opensourcing these provide other programs with an easily extensible baseline offering out-of-the-box solutions to problems that the ebola response encountered and incorporates key lessons from the Sierra Leone Ebola payment case.

The ERP is Odoo based and this repository houses the set of [Odoo](https://odoo.com) addons that constitutes the OpenG2P ERP.

Installation
------------
Easier to just grab the [docker](https://github.com/OpenG2P/erp-docker)

However if you know what you are doing, these install like any odoo addons and depends on this set of curated [community addons](https://github.com/OpenG2P/openg2p-erp-community-addon).
